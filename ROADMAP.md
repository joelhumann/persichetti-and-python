# Persichetti and Python — Roadmap

## Vision
To create a rigorous, modular compositional and analytical framework in Python based on Vincent Persichetti's *Twentieth-Century Harmony*, while enabling expanded musical exploration through code.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Core Pedagogy & Tools (In Progress)
- [x] `intervals.py` — classify intervals by type and textural character.
- [x] `scales.py` — define pitch-class sets and modal systems.
- [x] `pitch_context.py` — enforce modal/atonal pitch rules.
- [x] `melodic_motif.py` — single-line rhythmic + pitch logic.
- [ ] `texture.py` — intervallic and polyphonic texture tools.
- [ ] `time.py` — metric and quantum temporal logic.
- [ ] Musical examples and test coverage for all above.

### Phase 2: Composition System
- [ ] Motif transformation tools (inversion, retrograde, etc.)
- [ ] Voice leading and spacing rules.
- [ ] Chord structure and simultaneity tools.
- [ ] Event-based compositional logic (Musical Inertial Frames).

### Phase 3: Pedagogy, Rendering, and GUI
- [ ] Curriculum scaffolding and markdown guides.
- [ ] LilyPond rendering (`engravers/`).
- [ ] Simple GUI for input/output experiments.

## Long-Term Dreams
- Compositional DSL for music-theoretical exploration.
- Integration with tuning systems, orchestration models, and historical grammars.
- A modern composer's toolbox, grounded in historical theory, powered by Python.

Open to suggestions, forks, parallel explorations, and critiques. Let the music/code evolve.
