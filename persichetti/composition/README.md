# Composition Toolkit

This directory contains general-purpose compositional tools, adaptable to both historical and contemporary styles. These tools extend the `persichetti/` logic and offer flexible pathways for generating musical material.

## Modules

- `motives.py`: Motif structures and transformations (invert, retrograde, transpose).
- `rhythm.py`: Rhythmic pattern design, alignment, and variation.
- `harmonizer.py`: Harmonization routines using modal, tonal, or atonal systems.
- `bassline.py`: Bassline and root motion generators.
- `form.py`: Formal templates and phrase structure logic.
- `orchestrator.py`: Registral distribution and voicing helpers.
- `generators.py`: Thematic and phrase-level material generators.
