# Persichetti Project

A Python-based compositional and pedagogical system inspired by Vincent Persichetti’s *Twentieth-Century Harmony*.

> ⚠️ Pre-alpha – this project is under active development.

## 📦 Project Structure

- `core/` – Modules based on chapters of *Twentieth-Century Harmony*
- `fundamentals/` – Core musical primitives (pitch, tuning, time)
- `branches/` – Parallel topics (e.g. tuning systems, orchestration)
- `composition/`, `analysis/`, `output/`, `pedagogy/`, `utils/` – Supporting tools

## 🚧 Current Focus

- `intervals.py`, `texture.py`, `scales.py`, and `time.py`
- Persichetti’s intervallic tension system and modal logic
- Fundamental quantum of musical time (FQMT)

## 🧪 Status

Preliminary structure in place; modules are actively evolving. Not yet ready for external use.
