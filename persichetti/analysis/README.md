# Analysis Toolkit

This directory contains general-purpose tools for analyzing music based on interval structure, contour, texture, form, and tuning.

## Modules

- `interval_profile.py`: Analyze interval types, spacing, and tension.
- `contour.py`: Analyze melodic contour and shape over time.
- `harmonic_density.py`: Calculate span, density, and dissonance levels.
- `modal_analysis.py`: Detect modal centers or scalar pitch classes.
- `tuning_comparator.py`: Compare the same material across tuning systems.
- `texture.py`: Analyze voice spacing, register, and density.
- `formal_analysis.py`: Identify motivic repetition, transformation, and large-scale form.
