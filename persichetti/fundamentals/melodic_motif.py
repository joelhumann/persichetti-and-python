class MelodicMotif:
    """
    Represents a monophonic sequence of musical elements (Notes and Rests).

    A MelodicMotif may be:
    - Free (unquantized): all elements must have duration=None.
    - Rhythmic (quantized): all elements must have a numerical duration,
      expressed in integer or fractional multiples of a quantum time unit.

    ------------------
    RHYTHMIC STRUCTURE:

    Durations may be:
    - Integer (e.g. 1, 2, 4) for simple subdivisions
    - Fractional (e.g. 2/3, 3/5, 7/8) for complex tuplets

    All durations must share a common interpretation via a quantum time unit
    (typically specified in a `TimeContext`).

    ------------------
    PITCH STRUCTURE:

    A motif may include:
    - Pitched notes (int)
    - Unpitched notes (pitch=None)
    - Rests (no pitch)

    Pitched notes are interpreted as:
    - Relative pitch classes (semitones) if `pitch_context` is None
    - Validated modal/tonal pitches if `pitch_context` is provided

    ------------------
    Example:
        [Note(0, Fraction(2, 3)), Note(2, Fraction(1, 3)), Rest(Fraction(1, 3))]
        â†’ Tuplet-like rhythmic grouping (e.g. 3 in the time of 2)
