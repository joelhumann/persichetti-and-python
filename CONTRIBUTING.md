# Contributing to Persichetti and Python

Welcome! This project is an experimental, long-term effort to create a composer's operating system, starting with a programmatic translation of Vincent Persichetti's *Twentieth-Century Harmony* into Python modules.

Whether you're a composer, theorist, developer, or curious musician, contributions are welcome. Even if you're just exploring, feel free to fork, open an issue, or suggest improvements.

## Ground Rules
- Be kind and constructive.
- Prioritize clarity: code and theory should be explainable.
- Match the project's tone: this is "bare-metal musicology" â€” precise, rigorous, and sometimes philosophical.

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork the repo** and clone it locally.
2. Set up the environment using the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the tests: `pytest`.
4. Add new features, modules, or docs that align with the structure (see ROADMAP.md).
5. Run linting: `flake8`.
6. Open a pull request with a clear explanation of what you're contributing and why.

## What We're Looking For
- Enhancements to core modules (intervals, scales, pitch context, motif construction, etc.)
- Pedagogical clarity in docstrings and comments.
- Notebook examples, especially those demonstrating music-theoretical ideas.
- Musical insights encoded as code.

## Need Help?
Open an issue with your question or idea. Discussion is welcome!
